  Conventional wisdom dictates that the key to a better quality, higher-paying job is more
  education. Generally, this hypothesis holds true—those who go to <a

    target="_blank">college make more than those who don't</a
  >, and those who earn graduate degrees tend to have the highest wages. But looking closer, a
  different picture emerges. When broken out by race and gender—even after decades of increased
  educational attainment by people of color—<a

    target="_blank">job-quality disparities remain</a

  Consider electricians versus food and beverage service workers. Even just reading the occupation
  names, a preexisting bias of one requiring more education than the other probably bubbles up.
  Except both occupations have equivalent distributions of educational attainment: a high school
  credential at the 20th percentile and some college credits at the 80th percentile.

<p>
  Despite requiring the same level of education, electricians make roughly double the median income
  of food and beverage workers. But wages aren't the only indicator of job quality. If we factor in
  a selection of 10 other indicators, such as health insurance and regular scheduling, electricians
  have a job-quality score of 7 compared with food and beverage workers' score of 3.
